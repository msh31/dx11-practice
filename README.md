# DirectX 11 Practice

Learning DirectX 11 graphics programming from scratch. Following tutorials and building projects to understand how modern graphics APIs work.

## üéØ Goals

- Learn DirectX 11 fundamentals and rendering pipeline
- Build interactive menus and debug interfaces
- Get comfortable with graphics programming concepts
- Eventually make tools with proper UI instead of console applications

## üöÄ Current Status

Just starting out with DirectX. Working through ChiliTomatoNoodle's tutorial series to learn the basics.

## Why DirectX?

Most of my projects so far have been console applications or basic Windows forms. I want to learn how to create proper interfaces and eventually build tools that look professional instead of just functional.
